"""
VenueFlow AI — Crowd Routing Analyzer
Fastest-path gate assignment using a Min-Heap / Priority Queue.

Algorithm
─────────
For each gate, compute a *composite score*:

    score = (queue_length / throughput_rate) + α · distance_meters

where α is a tunable weight (default 0.05 s/m) that converts distance
into an equivalent wait-time penalty.

All scores are pushed into a **min-heap** so the optimal gate is always
at the root.

Complexity
──────────
  • heapify  : O(N)          where N = number of gates
  • pop best : O(log N)
  • K users  : O(K · log N)  amortised with re-heapify after updates

Space: O(N) for the heap.
